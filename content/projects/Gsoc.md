As a Google Summer of Code Scholar with MIT App Inventor, I developed and enhanced core iOS components to bring feature parity with the Android version. This included implementing modular UI elements and integrating hardware-level capabilities such as sensors and biometric authentication, contributing to the foundation of a robust and user-friendly iOS app-building experience.
